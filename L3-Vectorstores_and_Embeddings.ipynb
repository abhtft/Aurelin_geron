Good morning. Welcome to CS229, the machine \\nlearning class. So what I wanna do today is just spend a little time going over the logistics \\nof the class, and then we'll start to talk a bit about machine learning.  \\nBy way of introduction, my name's Andrew Ng and I'll be instructor for this class. And so \\nI personally work in machine learning, and I've worked on it for about 15 years now, and \\nI actually think that machine learning is the most exciting field of all the computer \\nsciences. So I'm actually always excited about teaching this class. Sometimes I actually \\nthink that machine learning is not only the most exciting thing in computer science, but \\nthe most exciting thing in all of human endeavor, so maybe a little bias there.  \\nI also want to introduce the TAs, who are all graduate students doing research in or \\nrelated to the machine learning and all aspects of machine learning. Paul Baumstarck \\nworks in machine learning and computer vision. Catie Chang is actually a neuroscientist \\nwho applies machine learning algorithms to try to understand the human brain. Tom Do \\nis another PhD student, works in computational biology and in sort of the basic \\nfundamentals of human learning. Zico Kolter is the head TA — he's head TA two years \\nin a row now — works in machine learning a nd applies them to a bunch of robots. And \\nDaniel Ramage is — I guess he's not here  — Daniel applies l earning algorithms to\"),\n",

And machine learning is one of \\nthose things that has and is having a large impact on many applications.  \\nSo just in my own daily work, I actually frequently end up talking to people like \\nhelicopter pilots to biologists to people in computer systems or databases to economists \\nand sort of also an unending stream of people from industry coming to Stanford \\ninterested in applying machine learning methods to their own problems.  \\nSo yeah, this is fun. A couple of weeks ago, a student actually forwarded to me an article \\nin \"Computer World\" about the 12 IT skills that employers can\\'t say no to. So it\\'s about \\nsort of the 12 most desirable skills in all of IT and all of information technology, and \\ntopping the list was actually machine learning.

And every time I teach this class, I can actually \\nvery confidently say that after December, no matter what you're going to do after this \\nDecember when you've sort of completed this class, you'll find the things you learn in \\nthis class very useful, and these things will be useful pretty much no matter what you end \\nup doing later in your life.  \\nSo I have more logistics to go over later, but let's say a few more words about machine \\nlearning. I feel that machine learning grew out of early work in AI, early work in artificial \\nintelligence. And over the last — I wanna say last 15 or last 20 years or so, it's been \\nviewed as a sort of growing new capability for computers. And in particular, it turns out \\nthat there are many programs or there are many applications that you can't program by \\nhand.  \\nFor example, if you want to get a computer to read handwritten characters, to read sort of \\nhandwritten digits, that actually turns out to be amazingly difficult to write a piece of \\nsoftware to take this input, an image of something that I wrote and to figure out just what \\nit is, to translate my cursive handwriting into — to extract the characters I wrote out in \\nlonghand. And other things: One thing that my students and I do is autonomous flight. It \\nturns out to be extremely difficult to sit down and write a program to fly a helicopter.\"),\n",

It uses applications that are hard to program by hand.  \\nLearning algorithms has also made I guess significant inroads in what's sometimes called \\ndatabase mining. So, for example, with the growth of IT and computers, increasingly \\nmany hospitals are keeping around medical records of what sort of patients, what \\nproblems they had, what their prognoses was, what the outcome was. And taking all of \\nthese medical records, which started to be digitized only about maybe 15 years, applying \\nlearning algorithms to them can turn raw medical records into what I might loosely call \\nmedical knowledge in which we start to detect trends in medical practice and even start to \\nalter medical practice as a result of medical knowledge that's derived by applying \\nlearning algorithms to the sorts of medical records that hospitals have just been building \\nover the last 15, 20 years in an electronic format.  \\nTurns out that most of you probably use learning algorithms — I don't know — I think\"),\n",

If you know what an eigenvector of a matrix is, that'd be even better. \\nBut if you don't quite know or if you're not quite sure, that's fine, too.

And in fact, I guess many of you are \\nprobably watching this at home on TV, so I'm gonna say hi to our home viewers.  \\nSo earlier this year, I approached SCPD, which televises these classes, about trying to \\nmake a small number of Stanford classes publicly available or posting the videos on the \\nweb. And so this year, Stanford is actually starting a small pilot program in which we'll \\npost videos of a small number of classes online, so on the Internet in a way that makes it \\npublicly accessible to everyone. I'm very excited about that because machine learning in \\nschool, let's get the word out there.  \\nOne of the consequences of this is that — let's see — so videos  or pictures of the students \\nin this classroom will not be posted online, so your images — so don't worry about being \\nby seeing your own face appear on YouTube one day. But the microphones may pick up \\nyour voices, so I guess the consequence of that is that because microphones may pick up \\nyour voices, no matter how irritated you are at me, don't yell out swear words in the \\nmiddle of class, but because there won't be video you can safely sit there and make faces \\nat me, and that won't show, okay?\"),\n",

So over time it learned things like that, \"Gee, if I get a lot of pieces taken by the \\nopponent, then I\\'m more likely to lose than win,\" or, \"Gee, if I get my pieces into a \\ncertain position, then I\\'m especially likely to win rather than lose.\"  \\nAnd so over time, Arthur Samuel had a checkers program that would actually learn to \\nplay checkers by learning what are the sort of board positions that tend to be associated'),\n",

Namely, Arthur Samuel \\nmanaged to write a checkers program that could play checkers much better than he \\npersonally could, and this is an instance of maybe computers learning to do things that \\nthey were not programmed explicitly to do.  \\nHere's a more recent, a more modern, more formal definition of machine learning due to \\nTom Mitchell, who says that a well-posed learning problem is defined as follows: He \\nsays that a computer program is set to learn from an experience E with respect to some \\ntask T and some performance measure P if its performance on T as measured by P \\nimproves with experience E. Okay. So not only is it a definition, it even rhymes.  \\nSo, for example, in the case of checkers, the experience E that a program has would be \\nthe experience of playing lots of games of checkers against itself, say. The task T is the \\ntask of playing checkers, and the performance measure P will be something like the \\nfraction of games it wins against a certain set of human opponents.

These are just a sort of small sample of the applications of unsupervised learning \\nalgorithms and clustering algorithms that we'll talk about later in this class.  \\nJust one particularly cool example of an unsupervised learning algorithm that I want to \\ntell you about. And to motivate that, I'm gonna tell you about what's called the cocktail \\nparty problem, which is imagine that you're at some cocktail party and there are lots of \\npeople standing all over. And you know how it is, right, if you're at a large party, \\neveryone's talking, it can be sometimes very hard to hear even the person in front of you.\"),\n",

It sounds like a pretty complicated thing to do. So you're gonna ask how complicated \\nis it really to implement an algorithm like this? It turns out if you do it in MATLAB, you \\ncan do it in one line of code.  \\nSo I got this from Samuel Wyse at Toronto, U of Toronto, and the example I showed you \\nactually used a more complicated ICA algorithm than this. But nonetheless, I guess this is \\nwhy for this class I'm going to ask you to do most of your programming in MATLAB and \\nOctave because if you try to implement the same algorithm in C or Java or something, I \\ncan tell you from personal, painful experience, you end up writing pages and pages of \\ncode rather than relatively few lines of code. I'll also mention that it did take researchers \\nmany, many years to come up with that one line of code, so this is not easy.  \\nSo that was unsupervised learning, and then the last of the four major topics I wanna tell \\nyou about is reinforcement learning.

If I give you the keys \\nto an autonomous helicopter — we actually ha ve this helicopter here at Stanford, — how \\ndo you write a program to make it fly, right? You notice that if you make a wrong \\ndecision on a helicopter, the consequence of crashing it may not happen until much later. \\nAnd in fact, usually you need to make a whole sequence of bad decisions to crash a \\nhelicopter. But conversely, you also need to make a whole sequence of good decisions in \\norder to fly a helicopter really well.  \\nSo I'm gonna show you some fun videos of learning algorithms flying helicopters. This is \\na video of our helicopter at Stanford flying using a controller that was learned using a \\nreinforcement learning algorithm. So this was done on the Stanford football field, and \\nwe'll zoom out the camera in a second. You'll sort of see the trees planted in the sky.

And \\nthen it\\'s up to the learning algorithm to figure out how to maximize the \"good dog\" \\nreward signals and minimize the \"bad dog\" punishments.  \\nSo it turns out reinforcement learning is applied to other problems in robotics.
